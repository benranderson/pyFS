"""
This module represents the Load Definintion task in the FS2000 GUI. The aim is
that this module provides equivalent functionality to the Load Definition task
through an instance of the LoadDefinition class.

Designing the object heirarchy this way allows multiple LoadDefinitions to be
defined in a pyFS list and these can be used  with single or multiple Model,
Analysis of Post-Processing objects in a single pyFS model.
